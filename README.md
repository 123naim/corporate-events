** My Website Featured:- 

- 1: I have created a website for Corporate Events. When you enter the website, you will land on the home page. The navbar includes a logo, Home, About Us, Sponsor, Sign In and Sign Up buttons. If you click on 'Sign Up,' you will be taken to the sign-up page, and if you click on 'Sign In,' you will be directed to the sign-in page.

- 2: On the home page, there are three sections: 'Featured Events,' 'Featured Organizers,' and 'Popular Speakers.' When you click 'View Details' on a featured event card, it will display the details of that event on page. If you are logged in, additional information may be available.

- 3: If you click on the 'About Us' page, and you are already signed in, it will take you to that page. However, if you are not signed in, it will redirect you to the sign-in page. The same system applies to the 'Sponsor' page as well.

- 4: In the 'Featured Events' section, you will find various services related to corporate events, such as conferences and seminars, trade shows and expos, team-building workshops, product launches, and more

- 5: The website includes a logout system. If you are logged in, you will see a 'Logout' option. If you are not logged in, you will see the 'Sign In' and 'Sign Up' buttons. Clicking the 'Logout' button will log you out of your account.
